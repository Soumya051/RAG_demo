Radiology involves medical imaging techniques to diagnose and manage a wide range of health problems affecting different parts of the body. Radiologists interpret X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and ultrasound images to provide valuable insights into a patient's condition, including bone fractures, tumors, organ abnormalities, vascular diseases, and lung conditions.
