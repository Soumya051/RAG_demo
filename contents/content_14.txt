Obstetrics is concerned with health problems related to pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. Obstetricians provide comprehensive care to expectant mothers and their infants, addressing health problems such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm labor, and birth complications. They also perform deliveries, including cesarean sections (C-sections).
