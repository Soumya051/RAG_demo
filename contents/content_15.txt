Urology addresses health problems involving the urinary tract and male reproductive system. Urologists diagnose and treat conditions affecting the kidneys, bladder, prostate, and genitalia, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), kidney stones, prostate cancer, and erectile dysfunction. They perform surgical procedures like kidney stone removal and vasectomy.
