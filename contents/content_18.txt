Physical therapy aims to rehabilitate individuals after health problems, injuries, or surgeries by improving physical function, mobility, and pain management. Physical therapists develop personalized treatment plans to address health problems related to post-surgery recovery, sports injuries, chronic pain conditions, and neurological impairments. They provide therapeutic exercises, manual therapy, and patient education.
