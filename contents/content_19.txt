Genetics studies health problems related to genetic disorders, inherited diseases, and the role of genetics in health and disease. Geneticists diagnose and manage health problems such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, and hereditary cancers. They provide genetic counseling and testing to assess risk factors and guide treatment decisions.
