Neurology focuses on health problems related to the nervous system, encompassing the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Neurologists diagnose and manage health problems like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and neuropathies. They may utilize imaging techniques like MRI and EEG for diagnosis.
